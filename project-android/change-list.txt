Change List
In my design I was able creates all the layout function and variables I would needed, but the functions and variables to implement user actions were lacking.  To correct this I will need to think more about how I will react to a user’s actions in my design. For example in my design I completely forgot to add any functions or variables for my missile object so the user could destroy the other ship and win.  Those variables included a timer variable to slow down the missile and a draw line operation that displayed the missiles on the screen. If I were to design this again I would definitely spend more time in planning out how to move objects on the screen. For example, I would use timers to slow down objects moving on the screen and make it where enemy objects could move forward and backwards instead of side to side. If I would have put more thought and time into planning how to move objects on the screen it would have saved me a lot of time creating my program. With that extra time I could have made my program better by making the enemy ships able to move in all sorts of directions instead of just side to side. Which has taught me the importants of why you should have a good design, because it makes writing the program easier and it saves time so you are able to perfect your program.
